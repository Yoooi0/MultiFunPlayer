# About

MultiFunPlayer synchronizes your devices (e.g. [OSR](https://www.patreon.com/tempestvr) or [buttplug.io](https://buttplug.io)) with your video files using funscripts. The player has the ability to synchronize multiple devices with multiple funscripts at the same time enabling enhanced experience.
