# About

MultiFunPlayer is a simple app to synchronize your devices (e.g. [OSR](https://www.patreon.com/tempestvr) or [buttplug.io](https://buttplug.io) supported devices) with any video using funscripts. Supported video players are [DeoVR](https://deovr.com/), [MPV](https://mpv.io/), [MPC-HC/BE](https://github.com/clsid2/mpc-hc), [HereSphere](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1234730/HereSphere/) and [Whirligig](http://whirligig.xyz/).
The player's main feature is the ability to play multiple funscripts at the same time, allowing for greater movement fidelity.

# How To

To synchronize with videos, start your desired video player and wait for automatic connection or click on the connect button to connect manually *(NOTE: DeoVR, Whirligig and HereSphere require you to enable remote support in their settings)*. Once connected, the funscripts can be loaded in several ways:

* Manually, by dragging a funscript file from windows explorer and dropping it on the desired axis `File` text box.
* Manually, by using the `Script->Load` menu in the axis settings toolbar.
* Automatically, based on the currently played video file name if the funscripts are named correctly:
