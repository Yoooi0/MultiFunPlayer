# How To

To synchronize with videos:

* Add desired video player via the top-right "plus" button
* Configure if needed by expanding settings with the "arrow" button on the right side
* Click connect *(NOTE: DeoVR, Whirligig and HereSphere require you to enable remote server/control support in their settings)*
* Add desired output via the bottom-right "plus" button
* Configure by expanding settings with the "arrow" button on the right side
* Click connect

Once your video player and output are connected, scripts can be loaded in several ways:

* Manually, by dragging a script file from windows explorer and dropping it on the desired axis `File` text box.
* Manually, by using the `Script->Load` menu in the axis settings toolbar.
* Automatically, based on the currently played video file name if the scripts are named correctly:
